# Space Guard (2D Programming Project)
This game is a top-down shooter in which the player can collect resources to purchase upgrades to make them stronger.

# How to Play
- WASD = Movement
- Arrow Keys = Firing
- E = Interact
- ESC = Exit

Goal: conquer waves of enemies and use the resources you collect to make yourself stronger.

# Testing Deliverables
The deliverables for this project are:
- An Interactable Environment
- UI
- A Functional Entity System
- This README file
- File Read/Write Access
- Twin-Stick Controls
- A Shop
- 5 or more Resources to Collect
- 5 or more Enemy Types to Fight
- 5 upgrade paths

To test the file read/write access: Start a new game, make some progress (or test some other deliverables), and save. Then attempt to open the save after closing and reopening the game.

The resources are kept in the left room, the shop in the right, and the combat zone in the bottom room. Upgrade paths are purchased within the shop.

Twin-Stick Controls: player should be able to move and fire independently from each other in all four directions.
